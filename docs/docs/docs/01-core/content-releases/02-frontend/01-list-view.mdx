### Overview

The list-view provides a comprehensive display of all available content releases. Organized into two tabs, it efficiently categorizes content into pending releases (those not yet published) and completed releases (already published).

#### New Release Creation:

The creation of a new release is made simple with the inclusion of a dedicated button. When activated, this button opens a modal housing a user-friendly form. Importantly, access to this creation feature is contingent on the user holding the necessary permission, specifically `plugin::content-releases.create` otherwise the button is disabled. And for validation the release name needs to be unique and not empty.

#### License limits

A notification is presented above the releases list if, upon page load or after a release creation, the user reaches the license limit. Additionally, the "New release" button is automatically disabled to prevent the creation of any new releases under these circumstances.

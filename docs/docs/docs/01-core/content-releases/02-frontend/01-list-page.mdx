### Overview

The releases page provides a comprehensive display of all available content releases. Content is organized into two tabs: 'pending' (releases not yet published) and 'done' (releases already published).

#### New Release Creation:

If a user has the permissions to create a release a 'New release' button will be present in the header. Clicking the button opens a form requiring a unique release name.

#### License limits

If the user reaches the limit of maximum pending releases defined on their license then the 'New release' button is disabled and a banner is displayed to inform the user.

## Summary

Content releases is an enterprise feature so you need a valid license.
Additionally, your user role must be granted specific Permissions, such as `plugin::content-releases.read` and `plugin::content-releases.create-action`. You can modify these permissions in the Settings section. The capability to add entries to a release within the content manager is available through the content-manager edit view.

### Edit view

If the feature is enabled with the correct license, and the user role has the necessary permissions enabled, a 'Releases' sidebar will appear next to the edit view. Within this sidebar, you'll find an 'Add to release' button that, when clicked, opens a modal allowing you to assign the entry to a specific release and specify the desired action (Publish/Unpublish).

In the event that no releases are present, users need to create a release first, which can be done on the [Content Releases](../content-releases/00-intro.md) page.

If the user role also includes the `plugin::content-releases.delete-action` permission, the user can access additional options by clicking the 'More' button (represented by three dots) in the releases sidebar. This will reveal the 'Remove from release' button, providing the ability to detach the entry from the selected release.
